# Fatal-Foundations
Indepth game modification for Stellaris

The bonds between our realities are breaking down. Things that should not exist are finding their way through. How can we fight that which we cannot comprehend?

Features:
-New Mid-game Crisis: Overgrowth
-New Event Chains
-New Anomalies
-New L-Gate Event [Distant Stars Required]
-New Excavation [Ancient Relics Required]
-New Quests

Compatibility:
No DLC's are mandatory, but some events will not fire without them.
No vanilla files overwritten.
Save game compatible.
Not expressly tested with any other mods, so if any conflicts arise, let me know.
